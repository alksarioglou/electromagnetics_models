# Electromagnetics Laboratory Internship - Animations and 3D Models for Electromagnetic Fields Lecture
- Created several **software and hardware demonstrators** that could be used in the lectures of the first-year Electromagnetic Fields module to illustrate the key concepts and examples
- Developed software examples such as **3D models and animations** to help illustrate selected tutorial examples and concepts, especially to highlight the 3D geometrical aspects using SolidWorks (found in the `Animations` directory)
- Designed, built (laser-cut or 3D-print) and tested **demonstration pieces to use as practical examples, such as a DC motor** (found in the rest of the directories). \
