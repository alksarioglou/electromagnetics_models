# Electromagnetics Laboratory Internship 
# Animations and 3D Models for Electromagnetic Fields Lecture
Created several software and hardware demonstrators that could be used in the lectures of the first-year Electromagnetic Fields module to illustrate the key concepts and examples Developed software examples such as 3D models and animations to help illustrate selected tutorial examples and concepts, especially to highlight the 3D geometrical aspects using SolidWorks Designed, built (laser-cut) and tested demonstration pieces to use as practical examples, such as a DC motor
